**Blog Web Application Schema**

Here is a possible schema for the requirements mentioned:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  email: String!
  password: String!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

type BlogPost {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  tags: [String!]!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  author: User!
  comments: [Comment!]!
}

type Comment {
  id: ID!
  content: String!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  author: User!
  blogPost: BlogPost!
}

type Query {
  blogPosts(sortBy: String): [BlogPost!]!
  searchBlogPosts(keyword: String!): [BlogPost!]!
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(username: String!, email: String!, password: String!): User!
  updateUser(id: ID!, username: String, email: String, password: String): User!
  deleteUser(id: ID!): User!
  createBlogPost(title: String!, content: String!, tags: [String!]!): BlogPost!
  updateBlogPost(id: ID!, title: String, content: String, tags: [String!]): BlogPost!
  deleteBlogPost(id: ID!): BlogPost!
  createComment(content: String!, blogPostId: ID!): Comment!
  updateComment(id: ID!, content: String): Comment!
  deleteComment(id: ID!): Comment!
}
```

This schema defines the necessary types and fields to support the requirements of the blog web application. It includes types for User, BlogPost, and Comment, along with queries and mutations for creating, updating, and deleting data. The schema also includes fields for sorting and searching blog posts.

To create a Prisma schema for the given requirements, you can define the following models:

```prisma
model User {
  id        String      @id @default(uuid())
  username  String
  email     String   @unique
  password  String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  blogPosts Blog[]
}

model UserProfile{
  id        String      @id @default(uuid())
  userId    String
  firstName String
  lastName  String
  bio       String
  avatar    String
  title     String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}

model Blog {
  id        String      @id @default(uuid())
  title     String
  content   String
  images    String[]
  tags      String[]
  status    BlogStatus
  publishedAt? DateTime
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  String
  comments  Comment[]
}

enum BlogStatus{
  DRAFT
  PUBLISHED
  BLOCKED
}

model Comment {
  id        String      @id @default(uuid())
  title     String
  content   String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  String
  blogPost  Blog @relation(fields: [blogId], references: [id])
  blogPostId String
}
```

This Prisma schema defines the necessary models for User, BlogPost, and Comment. Each model has its own fields and relationships. The User model has a one-to-many relationship with BlogPost and Comment, while the BlogPost and Comment models have a many-to-one relationship with User.

Please note that this is just a basic schema and you may need to customize it further based on your specific requirements and database setup.
